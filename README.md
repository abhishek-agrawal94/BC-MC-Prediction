# BC Prediction
The current project aims to predict children’s encoding (producing cues to exhibit engagement or request feedback) and decoding (detecting backchannel or backchannel-inviting cues) abilities. The spontaneous conversational data involving children and adults come from the ChiCo Corpus(Bodur et al.,2021; https://doi.org/10.1145/3461615.3485399)

The SVM classifier based on ranked features is inspired by Van Bemmel et al., 2021 (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-87802-3_66)
The sequential model is based on Roddy et al., 2018 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.10785.pdf)
